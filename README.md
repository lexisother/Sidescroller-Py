### Git

First off is the Git CLI. Head over to [**Git-SCM**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the Git CLI.

After installing, you can use the following to check if Git is installed:

```text
$ git --version
```

It should output something like this:

```text
git version 2.25.0.windows.1
```

### Python

Next up, is [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Head over to the website and download the installer.

![Make sure to tick &quot;Add Python to Path&quot;](.gitbook/assets/windows-setup-run-the-python-installer.jpg)

To check the Python version, run the following:

```

It should output something like:
