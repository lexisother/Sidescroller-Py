# Setting up

First up, clone the repo using the previously installed Git CLI.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sparkiesoth/Sidescroller-Py
```

Once the repository has finished cloning, change to the directory and install all requirements.

$ cd Sidescroller-Py
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once `pip` has finished installing all requirements, you can run the game with:

```text
python main.py
```
